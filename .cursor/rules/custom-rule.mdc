# **rules**
Be cautious and always ask user if they are ready before making modifications.
Always research how to do things first using your internet search tools as often as you can. Be smart about what you search for when you search for knowledge.
Always be context aware and codebase aware of the implementations you are doing if you are unsure ask the user what his intention is or if he wants a simple approach or more sophisticated approach and follow up with suggestion and planning through how to integrate those approaches before you continue.
**ALWAYS MAKE A TODO-LIST!!!!**
**IN THE TODO-LIST ADD (RESEARCH THIS BEFORE IMPLEMENTING IT) SO YOU REMEMBER TO RESEARCH THINGSâ€¦**
