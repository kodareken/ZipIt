## 🎯 The Problem

macOS handles ZIP files natively, but **doesn't support RAR files** out of the box. Users typically install The Unarchiver, but recent versions have introduced:
- 🚫 **Advertisement popups** 
- 🚫 **Bloated interface**
- 🚫 **Outdated user experience**

> *"The Unarchiver has started showing ads and shit. So now in a modern era where AI can help you create your own Apps within minutes, we just created this app that people can use for free."* - [Reddit Discussion](https://www.reddit.com/r/MacOS/comments/1dug070/whats_a_good_unarchiver_alternative_do_i_even/)

- ✅ **RAR Support** - The main reason you need this app
- ✅ **Quick Extract** - Cmd+Down Arrow for instant extraction
