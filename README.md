**ZipIt** is a modern, free, and open-source archive extractor for macOS built with SwiftUI. Created as a clean alternative to The Unarchiver, ZipIt provides native macOS integration without ads or bloatware.

## üéØ The Problem

macOS handles ZIP files natively, but **doesn't support RAR files** out of the box. Users typically install The Unarchiver, but recent versions have introduced:
- üö´ **Advertisement popups** 
- üö´ **Bloated interface**
- üö´ **Outdated user experience**

> *"The Unarchiver has started showing ads and shit. So now in a modern era where AI can help you create your own Apps within minutes, we just created this app that people can use for free."* - [Reddit Discussion](https://www.reddit.com/r/MacOS/comments/1dug070/whats_a_good_unarchiver_alternative_do_i_even/)
